# AcademicArticles-NLP-NeuralNetwork

In this project, the dataset that I will be working with are the Academic Articles. There are 3 classes, which are InfoTheory, CompVis and Math. These can occur in any combination, so an article could be all three at once, two, one or none. I will build text classifiers that predict each of these three classes individually using the Abstract field.

In particular for this project, I will build 2 different families of model. 1 family of model is of more statistical approach, which is Logistic Regression. The other family of model is involving deep learning, which is Recurrent Neural Network. For the training of Recurrent Neural Network, I will make use of GPU option on Google Colab, to accelerate the training of the neural networks.

At the end, I will make use of various Machine Learning, in particular Classification, evaluation metrics, to compare the model performance of these 2 families of model, on the testing set. These evaluation metrics include Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Precision-Recall curve and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of this Precision-Recall Curve.
